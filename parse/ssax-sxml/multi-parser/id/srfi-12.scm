; Exception conditions
; The following is an approximate implementation of conditions that
; uses lists, instead of a disjoint class of values
; The code below is basically the reference SRFI-12 implementation,
; with a few types fixed.

; A condition is represented as a pair where the first value of the
; pair is this function. A program could forge conditions, and they're
; not disjoint from Scheme pairs.
; Exception conditions are disjoint from any other Scheme values
; (or so should appear).

; Procedure: make-property-condition KIND-KEY PROP-KEY VALUE ...
; This procedure accepts any even number of arguments after kind-key,
; which are regarded as a sequence of alternating prop-key and value
; objects. Each prop-key is regarded as the name of a property, and
; each value is regarded as the value associated with the key that
; precedes it. Returns a kind-key condition that associates the given
; prop-keys with the given values.

; Procedure: make-composite-condition CONDITION ...
; Returns a newly-allocated condition whose components correspond to
; the the given conditions. A predicate created by CONDITION-PREDICATE
; returns true for the new condition if and only if it returns true
; for one or more of its component conditions.

; make-property-condition, the predicate returns #t if and only if
; kind-key is EQV? to the kind key that was passed to
; make-property-condition. Given a composite condition created with

; the predicate returns #t for at least one of its components.

; that is associated with prop-key. Given a composite condition created with

; associated with prop-key in one of the components that

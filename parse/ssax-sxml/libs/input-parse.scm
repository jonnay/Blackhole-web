;	skips any number of the prefix characters (members of the

;	BREAK-CHAR-LIST.
;	The string of characters thus read is returned.

; Note: since we can't tell offhand how large the token being read is
; going to be, we make a guess, pre-allocate a string, and grow it by
; quanta if necessary. The quantum is always the length of the string
; before it was extended the last time. Thus the algorithm does
; a Fibonacci-type extension, which has been proven optimal.
; Note, explicit port specification in read-char, peek-char helps.

; Procedure input-parse:init-buffer
; returns an initial buffer for next-token* procedures.
; The input-parse:init-buffer may allocate a new buffer per each invocation:
;	(define (input-parse:init-buffer) (make-string 32))
; Size 32 turns out to be fairly good, on average.
; That policy is good only when a Scheme system is multi-threaded with
; preemptive scheduling, or when a Scheme system supports shared substrings.
; In all the other cases, it's better for input-parse:init-buffer to
; return the same static buffer. next-token* functions return a copy
; (a substring) of accumulated data, so the same buffer can be reused.
; We shouldn't worry about new token being too large: next-token will use
; a larger buffer automatically. Still, the best size for the static buffer
; is to allow most of the tokens to fit in.
; Using a static buffer _dramatically_ reduces the amount of produced garbage
; (e.g., during XML parsing).

; -- procedure+: next-token-of INC-CHARSET [PORT]
;	Reads characters from the PORT that belong to the list of characters
;	INC-CHARSET. The reading stops at the first character which is not
;	a member of the set. This character is left on the stream.
;	All the read characters are returned in a string.
;
; -- procedure+: next-token-of PRED [PORT]
;	Reads characters from the PORT for which PRED (a procedure of one
;	argument) returns non-#f. The reading stops at the first character
;	for which PRED returns #f. That character is left on the stream.
;	All the results of evaluating of PRED up to #f are returned in a
;	string.
;
;	PRED is a procedure that takes one argument (a character
;	or the EOF object) and returns a character or #f. The returned
;	character does not have to be the same as the input argument
;	to the PRED. For example,
;	(next-token-of (lambda (c)
;			  (cond ((eof-object? c) #f)
;				((char-alphabetic? c) (char-downcase c))
;				(else #f))))
;	will try to read an alphabetic token from the current
;	input port, and return it in lower case.

; This procedure is similar to next-token but only it implements
; an inclusion rather than delimiting semantics.

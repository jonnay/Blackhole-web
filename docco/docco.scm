;;; Documentation Module
;; This is to aid in auto-generation of documentation.
;; The future plan is to allow it to work in two modes
;; Mode 1 is to document what exists, and stuff it in an org-mode file
;; Mode 2 is to snarf what exists, and prep it for inclusion into a literate org-mode file.
;; Mode 1 is first.
